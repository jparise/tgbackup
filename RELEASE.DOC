    Telegard Backup
    Final Release
    Copyright (c) 1996-1997 by Jon Parise


    Well, hello, all.  You probably haven't heard much from me recently.
This is due to the fact that I've taken down my board permanently.  I
still remain active in Telegard's development, but I won't be running a
fulltime bulletin board system in the near future.
    With that decision, I've also decided to discontinue development of
most of my Telegard utilities, including Telegard Backup.  So that my work
doesn't go to waste, I've decided to release this version with the full
source code.
    IF you have any questions or comments, I can be reached via email at
jon@interpow.net or possibly through Fido's TG_SUPPORT.  I'll be glad to
give you a hand.
